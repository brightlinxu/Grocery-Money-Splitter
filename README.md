Hey everyone! This is an app that divides grocery bills - [link to web page](https://groceries.brightxu.com/)

I hope you find it useful and feel free to let me know if there's anything you want me to add or if anything isn't working properly.

## Current Features

You can add on costs that are specific to individuals (ex. someone bought something for just themself).

You can also select if someone is a vegetarian so they don't pay for non-vegetarian groceries.
